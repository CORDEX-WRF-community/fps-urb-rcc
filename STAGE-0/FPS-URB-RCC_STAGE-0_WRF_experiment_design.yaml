      Bound to a different set (and number) of vertical levels. Above the
      canopy layer the levels are the same. Levels below tallest model
      building are removed.

    description: >
      Allows assessing the existing EURO-CORDEX WRF simulations. Noah-LSM and
      Noah-MP would work as LSM over urban surfaces. No one has yet worked on
      the Noah urban parameters with LCZ. It would be interesting to design a
      strategy for that, maybe similar to SURY by Wouters et al. in COSMO.
