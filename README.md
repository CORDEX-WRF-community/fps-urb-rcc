# WRFcoordination
This repository is created for the coordination of the WRF simulations within the CORDEX FPS URB-RCC framework following [the simualtions protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R4O1x67Tpr-qcEPlkzKDvJP1itoxKPbaBZO9gpIfamc/edit).

At **STAGE 0** the test simulations will be performed in order to test RCMs and urban schemes, as well as model and domain set-up. For that, short-term simulations over the Paris region will be performed. Furthermore, the test simulations will cover two extreme events in 2020 (heat and heavy precipitation), which will allow for a coordinated analysis of these extreme events. 
In addition, these test simulations will prepare the ground for the coordinated evaluation simulations (**STAGE 1**).
