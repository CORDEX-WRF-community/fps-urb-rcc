# WRF setting for the PAR-3 nested nested into FRA-12

This branch contains the namelist files for the PAR-3 nested intp FRA-12 parent domain, which coincides with the smaller parent domain proposed in the [the simualtions protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R4O1x67Tpr-qcEPlkzKDvJP1itoxKPbaBZO9gpIfamc/edit):

All the necessary files for running a test simulation with the FRA-12 parent domain can be downloaded from this [link](https://meteo.unican.es/work/josipa/fps_urban_file_urb3_FRA12.tar). The procedure and the list of files coincides with the [instructions](https://github.com/FPS-URB-RCC/WRFcoordination/blob/main/README.md) given for the bigger EUR12 domain. The physics options are the same as for [the control run](https://github.com/FPS-URB-RCC/WRFcoordination/blob/main/namelist.input).
