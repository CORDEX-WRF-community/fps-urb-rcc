# Work to develop a WRF module specific to compute urban diagnostics
#

Following Martilli et al 2002, the urban scheme computes vertical profiles at a 'urban' vertical grid for momentum, temperature and TKE. The new diagnostics will be obtained following this urban vertical profiles.

The vertical profile of temperatures is called 'pt_u' inside the BEP1D subroutine (from phys/module_sf_bep.F) which computes all the terms in the column. We are going to get the values of this subroutine, since the outcome of the urban scheme is only at the surfaces of the buildings/roads and an averaged T2 following Monin-Obukhov theory (althougth recognized for not being fully correct).
